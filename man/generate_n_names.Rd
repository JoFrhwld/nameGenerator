\usage{
generate_n_names(n = 1, Year = 1950, Sex = "F")
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the number of random names to generate}

\item{Year}{the year from which training data is drawn}

See \code{generate_name()}

The first time using \code{most_prob_name()}, \code{generate_name()} or
\code{generate_n_names()} with a unique Year and Sex combination may take
a few seconds to run, but should be faster on any subsequent call to the same
function or any of the other two using the same Year and Sex combination.
