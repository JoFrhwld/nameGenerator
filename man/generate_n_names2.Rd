The first time using \code{most_prob_name2()}, \code{generate_name2()} or
\code{generate_n_names2()} with a unique Year and Sex combination may take
a few seconds to run, but should be faster on any subsequent call to the same
function or any of the other two using the same Year and Sex combination.
